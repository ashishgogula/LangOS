LangOS Demo App - Lingo.dev Implementation
I have successfully built the LangOS demo application to demonstrate a complete localization lifecycle using Lingo.dev tools, Next.js 16 (App Router), and Tailwind CSS.

Implementation Overview
1. Project Initialization
The App Router project is configured with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

2. Provider Setup & Configuration
next.config.ts
: Integrated the @lingo.dev/compiler/next wrapper.
app/layout.tsx
: Wrapped the entire application with the <LingoProvider> to enable server/client-side locale coordination context.
RtlProvider
: Automatically intercepts the "ar" locale from local storage on load and sets dir="rtl" at the document root to simulate RTL support.
3. Localization Demos
The project features three primary pages demonstrating Lingo SDK and standard i18n APIs:

Dashboard Demo (
app/page.tsx
):
Contains a dynamic translation interface.
Simulates an async call to 
translateText
 (simulating the lingo.dev/sdk run-time API).
Uses native browser APIs (Intl.NumberFormat, Intl.DateTimeFormat) to automatically render currency and dates localized dynamically based on localStorage state.
Billing (
app/billing/page.tsx
) & Settings (
app/settings/page.tsx
): Static layouts featuring clean, Tailwind-based configurations ready for Lingo's compiler step to extract strings.
4. Language Switcher
A custom <LanguageSwitcher> component built in 
src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx
.
Connects directly to localStorage, falling back to English. It also pushes a cookie which is common in Lingo SSR workflows for route preservation, resolving dynamically through Next.
5. Automation & CLI
package.json
: Added "lingo:run": "npx lingo.dev run" script.
i18n.json
: CLI config setup for extraction specifying src/**/*.{tsx,ts} outputting to .lingo.
.github/workflows/lingo.yml
: A preconfigured GitHub Action to run locale synchronization safely using the LINGO_API_KEY on push to the main branch.
NOTE

The app is fully configured. Running npm run build will actively invoke the Lingo.dev generation steps, which will require setting up a valid LINGO_API_KEY in your environmen
